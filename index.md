## Phew, finally a personal website?

Honestly, I have thought about doing this for awhile mainly to motivate myself to produce quality content for somebody to view. 
I'll try my best to document things here. Social media is too aggresive for me so I'll just stick to website which is more like a shouout to 
the world without worrying whether it'll echo back. That being said, feel free to reach out to me otherwise.
